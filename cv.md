## About me

I aim to work in Frontend programming branch. This area confers the possibility for my self-culture: improving the faculties of the mind, self-teaching, developing analytic mind and solving hard code tasks. My soft skills as handling criticism, getting point across and strong personal boundaries help me to healthy communicate and to be self-motivated.      
I’m sure I can reach my full potential as a web programmer.
